# JR Add Featured Image

Checks if the post has a featured image. If not it sets the featured image to the first image block in that post (if any).

## Description

This plugin is developed based on the Easy Add Thumbnail plugin by Samuel Aguilera. 

I needed it to work with Gutenberg, so did some tweaks for that. 

There are probably neater and cleaner way to do this, but this will have to do for now. Maybe I'll look into it more sometime in the future when I have more time.

## How to use

1. Clone this repo to your wp-content/plugins

2. Activate the plugin.

Done!
